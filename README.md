The Drupal Evernote module

This is being held here for a bit until I have a few minutes to re-familarize myself with tagging module releases on drupal.org.

Right now this module requires that you have PHP 5.3 and the OAuth PHP extension enabled.

Once you install the module, just go to /admin/settings/evernote, click the link to approve the connection, and configure your feed.
